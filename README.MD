Car Leasing Calculator Solution

To create a cohesive Car Leasing Calculator Solution, I began by constructing an HTML file to define the entire page structure. Subsequently, I developed essential CSS files:

reset.css: This file establishes baseline styles to reset default browser styles, ensuring consistency across different browsers.

typography.css: Here, I set the foundational typography rules, including the base font family, sizes, and other typographical elements.

layout.css: This file focuses on structuring the visual layout of the page, ensuring elements are properly positioned and spaced. I`m using flexdbox to achive the result

style.css: This serves as a comprehensive stylesheet where all previously defined styles are consolidated and applied to elements throughout the project.

Additionally, I implemented a JavaScript file where I crafted essential functions to enable interactive features and ensure the functional integrity of the Car Leasing Calculator Solution.
