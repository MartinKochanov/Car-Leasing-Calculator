Car Leasing Calculator Solution

Initially, I create an .html file to construct the entire page framework. Following this,
I develop a straightforward reset.css file that contains foundational styles essential for my elements.
Additionally, I establish a typography.css file to define my primary font and font sizes, and a layout.css 
file where I organize the visual structure of my page. Finally, I consolidate all these elements
into a style.css file, integrating and harmonizing the overall design of the solution.

In addition I implement a JavaScript file. This JavaScript file houses all the necessary
functions to ensure the functional integrity of the page. These functions are meticulously
crafted to enable the interactive and dynamic features essential for the Car Leasing Calculator Solution.
