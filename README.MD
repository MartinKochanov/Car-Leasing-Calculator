Car Leasing Calculator Solution<br>
<br>
To create a cohesive Car Leasing Calculator Solution, I began by constructing an HTML file to define the entire page structure. Subsequently, I developed essential CSS files:<br>
<br>
reset.css: This file establishes baseline styles to reset default browser styles, ensuring consistency across different browsers.<br>
typography.css: Here, I set foundational typography rules, including the base font family, sizes, and other typographical elements.<br>
layout.css: This file focuses on structuring the visual layout of the page, using flexbox to achieve the desired result.<br>
style.css: This serves as a comprehensive stylesheet where all previously defined styles are consolidated and applied to elements throughout the project.<br>
Additionally, I implemented a JavaScript file where I created essential functions to enable interactive features and ensure the functional integrity of the task's Solution.<br>
<br>
Lastly, and most importantly, I ensure everything is working as expected! ðŸ˜ƒ
